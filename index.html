<p>We're no strangers to love
You know the rules and so do I (do I)
A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
You wouldn't get this from any other guy
I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
Gotta make you understand
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
We've known each other for so long
Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
We know the game and we're gonna play it
And if you ask me how I'm feeling
Don't tell me you're too blind to see
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you
Never gonna give you up
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna run around and desert you
Never gonna make you cry
Never gonna say goodbye
Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you

<p>9/2/2022                      
This week we did alot of tinker cad things that were kinda boring as i did tinker cad in the past.
Alot of it was just basic tasks for us to get used to the website which i think is great but it doesnt really matter to me.
I also got sick this week but luckly i didnt miss any days of engineering which is pretty nice.</p>

<center> <p>9/16/2022 we worked on the rube goldberg machine this week and did the paper boat on water thing </p></center>

<center>9/23/22 we had a test this week it was pretty easy so thats nice but im pretty worried about my website </center>
<center><p> Febuary: During the month of febuary we started making mouse trap car designs on tinkercad, it was pretty fun because its like creating ideas easily then u can test them out later. Later in the month we started building these CADs and my first attempt at a mouse trap car was wobbley and not working well but later in march we improved it but made 1 mistake.</p></center>

<center><p> 3/7/23 we finished the mouse trap car assignment, our car didnt work very well as the rotating straw got slightly hot glued so it couldnt turn
